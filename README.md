My initial wireframes: I made sure the layout was simple but elegant whilst refereing to PARC![Wireframe for desktop]({{site.baseurl}}//wireframe1%20(1).png) and ![wireframe for mobile]({{site.baseurl}}/wireframe1 (1).png)

User Testing: I carried out user testing on 3 different people from 3 different generations in order to gain a full insight to all problems.

The first person I had to user test was my neighbour who is 66 years old. it was apparent that the animations caught her eye at first and then was a bit confused of what to do next. Also some elements she said were too small, as i saw her squinting at certain bits. Therefore to solve this problem, I had toned down some animations, added buttons to take you to the top of the screen and increased the text size.

The second person was my younger sister who is 10 years. She enjoyed the website and didnt seem to have any problems and i had her test on both mobile and computer. This is where I saw hesitation of what to do and noticed some information was too small to have in rows. To overcome this I used flex box to change the layout to columns, which allowed more easier veiwing on mobile phones.

The last person i had test was my aunty who is apparently 21 (41). She also had the same problem with size which would be solved by the change of layout and increase of size of certain elements. She also mentioned it doesn't look too professional to use as a portfolio page, however i believe it allows me to show off my personality.

Accessibilty
After the user testing with my neighbour who is 66 years old, i realised the key features of accessibility. I thus made sure no items were too small and cluttered. I also made sure to use appropriate alt tags for screen readers.

Navigation

I used the help of the labs and w3 schools for the navigation

Problems

as flex box and SVG was something i learned on my own i faced many problems trying to implement it, let alone incorproate it within my page. However i used many resources such as w3 schools, Youtube such as "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt0TxvX3_Lo" and "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc" for flexbox and "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM8eTD01UE8&t=1631s" to understand SVG. These resources helped me try to understand them both, however practise and trial and error was how i achieved my goal. Also to create SVG I used Adobe Illustrator which I downloaded using its Free Trial. I also had help from "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb5qOa3R4hY&t=328s" for the contact form.
